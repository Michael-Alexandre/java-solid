The SOLID principles are

The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."[5] In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.[6]

The Openâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."[7]

The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."[8] See also design by contract.[8]

The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."[9][4]

The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretes."[10][4]

The SOLID acronym was introduced later, around 2004, by Michael Feathers.[11]
